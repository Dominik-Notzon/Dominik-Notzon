The photograph presents an interior space defined by elegance and refinement, where architectural form becomes a canvas for ornamentation. The sweeping arches, enriched with sculptural reliefs and intricate mouldings, articulate a sense of grandeur typical of late Baroque and Rococo design traditions. Light filtering through the large circular and elongated stained-glass windows bathes the stone in a warm glow, softening the monumental quality of the staircase and emphasizing the balance between structure and decoration. The balustrades, curved staircases, and niches inhabited by sculpted figures lend rhythm and verticality to the space, guiding the viewerâ€™s eye upward. This interplay of light, ornament, and architectural flow transforms a transitional zone into a ceremonial passage, embodying both movement and contemplation.
